  abstract = {Background:               Public health emergencies require integration between multiple stakeholders in different sectors to monitor the situation and carry out an appropriate response. As a country with a large land area consisting of thousands of islands, Indonesia's centralized Public Health Emergency Operation Center (PHEOC) system is currently unable to effectively contain diseases. A PHEOC system reform is required to accommodate Indonesia's circumstances, particularly at the regional level. We have outlined potential models at the sub-national level for PHEOC based on existing evidence.                                         Policy Options and Recommendations:               Based on existing evidence of PHEOC models internationally, we have formulated three policy models for regional-level PHEOC. These models (the               ad hoc               agency model, the independent agency model, and the Province Health Office (PHO)-based model) entail different chains of command, and each has its own benefits.                                         Conclusion:               We recommend that the Ministry of Health in Indonesia adopt the third PHEOC policy model, in which the chain of command lies under the PHO. This is the most practical approach, as the PHO has the authority to mobilize units and access resources in response to imminent public health emergencies. Further training and capacity-building are required to support the PHO as the commander of the regional PHEOC.},

  abstract = {Background: Global COVID-19 outbreaks in early 2020 have burdened health workers, among them surveillance workers who have the responsibility to undertake routine disease surveillance activities. The aim of this study was to describe the quality of the implementation of Indonesia's Early Warning and Response Alert System (EWARS) for disease surveillance and to measure the burden of disease surveillance reporting quality before and during the COVID-19 epidemic in Indonesia. Methods: A mixed-method approach was used. A total of 38 informants from regional health offices participated in Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and In-Depth Interview (IDI) for informants from Ministry of Health. The FGD and IDI were conducted using online video communication. Yearly completeness and timeliness of reporting of 34 provinces were collected from the application. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, and quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. Results: Major implementation gaps were found in poorly distributed human resources and regional infrastructure inequity. National reporting from 2017--2019 showed an increasing trend of completeness (55\%, 64\%, and 75\%, respectively) and timeliness (55\%, 64\%, and 75\%, respectively). However, the quality of the reporting dropped to 53\% and 34\% in 2020 concomitant with the SARS-CoV2 epidemic. Conclusions: Report completeness and timeliness are likely related to regional infrastructure inequity and the COVID-19 epidemic. It is recommended to increase report capacities with an automatic EWARS application linked systems in hospitals and laboratories.},

This study explored the utilization of mobility data to predict COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta, Indonesia. We acquired aggregated and anonymized mobility data sets from 15 February to 31 December 2020. Three statistical models were explored: Poisson Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Negative Binomial Regression GLM, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Due to multicollinearity, three categories were reduced into one single index using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multiple Linear Regression with variable adjustments using PCA was the best-fit model, explaining 52\% of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta (R-Square: 0.52; p {$<$} 0.05). This study found that different types of mobility were significant predictors for COVID-19 cases and have different levels of impact on COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta, with the highest observed in ``grocery and pharmacy'' (4.12\%). This study demonstrates the practicality of using CMR data to help policymakers in decision making and policy formulation, especially when there are limited data available, and can be used to improve health system readiness by anticipating case surge, such as in the places with a high potential for transmission risk and during seasonal events.},

  abstract = {Sedentary behaviors and dietary intake are independently associated with obesity risk. In the literature, only a few studies have investigated gender differences for such associations. The present study aims to assess the association of sedentary behaviors and unhealthy foods intake with obesity in men and women in a comparative manner. The analysis presented in this study was based on the data from a population-based, cross-sectional, nationally representative survey (Indonesian Basic Health Research 2013/RISKESDAS 2013). In total, 222,650 men and 248,590 women aged 19--55 years were enrolled. A validated questionnaire, physical activity card, and food card were used for the assessments. The results showed that the prevalence of obesity (body mass index of {$\geq$}27.5 kg/m2) was higher in women (18.71\%) than in men (8.67\%). The mean body mass index in women tended to be higher than in men. After adjusting for age and education, the gender effect on obesity persisted in women and was more significant than in men. There was also a positive and significant effect on obesity of sedentary behaviors and unhealthy foods intake. Moreover, fatty and fried foods displayed a positive multiplicative interaction, increasing obesity risk in women more than in men and indicating a possible dietary risk in in women in relation to obesity. The study suggests that the implementation of educational programs on nutrition and physical activity is particularly important for promoting a healthy body weight among Indonesian women.},

  abstract = {As the obesity rate continues to increase persistently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective weight loss management strategy. Nowadays, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technologies coupled with the rapid spread of messaging platforms and mobile technology with easier access to internet technology offers professional dietitians an opportunity to provide extensive monitoring support to their clients through a chatbot with artificial empathy. This study aimed to design a chatbot with artificial empathic motivational support for weight loss called ``SlimMe'' and investigate how people react to a diet bot. The SlimMe infrastructure was built using Dialogflow as the natural language processing (NLP) platform and LINE mobile messenger as the messaging platform. We proposed a text-based emotion analysis to simulate artificial empathy responses to recognize the user's emotion. A preliminary evaluation was performed to investigate the early-stage user experience after a 7-day simulation trial. The result revealed that having an artificially empathic diet bot for weight loss management is a fun and exciting experience. The use of emoticons, stickers, and GIF images makes the chatbot response more interactive. Moreover, the motivational support and persuasive messaging features enable the bot to express more empathic and engaging responses to the user. In total, there were 1,007 bot responses from 892 user input messages. Of these, 67.38\% (601/1,007) of the chatbot-generated responses were accurate to a relevant user request, 21.19\% (189/1,007) inaccurate responses to a relevant request, and 10.31\% (92/1,007) accurate responses to an irrelevant request. Only 1.12\% (10/1,007) of the chatbot does not answer. We present the design of an artificially empathic diet bot as a friendly assistant to help users estimate their calorie intake and calories burned in a more interactive and engaging way. To our knowledge, this is the first chatbot designed with artificial empathy features, and it looks very promising in promoting long-term weight management. More user interactions and further data training and validation enhancement will improve the bot's in-built knowledge base and emotional intelligence base.},

  abstract = {Non-contact sensors are gaining popularity in clinical settings to monitor the vital parameters of patients. In this study, we used a non-contact sensor device to monitor vital parameters like the heart rate, respiration rate, and heart rate variability of hemodialysis (HD) patients for a period of 23 weeks during their HD sessions. During these 23 weeks, a total number of 3237 HD sessions were observed. Out of 109 patients enrolled in the study, 78 patients reported clinical events such as muscle spasms, inpatient stays, emergency visits or even death during the study period. We analyzed the sensor data of these two groups of patients, namely an event and no-event group. We found a statistically significant difference in the heart rates, respiration rates, and some heart rate variability parameters among the two groups of patients when their means were compared using an independent sample t-test. We further developed a supervised machine-learning-based prediction model to predict event or no-event based on the sensor data and demographic information. A mean area under curve (ROC AUC) of 90.16\% with 96.21\% mean precision, and 88.47\% mean recall was achieved. Our findings point towards the novel use of non-contact sensors in clinical settings to monitor the vital parameters of patients and the further development of early warning solutions using artificial intelligence (AI) for the prediction of clinical events. These models could assist healthcare professionals in taking decisions and designing better care plans for patients by early detecting changes to vital parameters.},
